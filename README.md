# UV-VIS-spectrometry

In this project, we designed and built an UV-Vis spectrophotometry using LDR light
sensor and servo motor. We designed a logic part where the wavelength can be
controlled using the servo motor which has a prism attached to it. With the sample placed
in the sample holder, the selected light wavelength passes through the sample and the
LDR sensor will be able to read the absorbance of the sample.
